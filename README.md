# Water Quality Prediction - RMS
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.
# Overview
Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor
Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics
# Technologies Used
Python 3.12
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
